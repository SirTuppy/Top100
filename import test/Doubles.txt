He thought it might be 8B. I was intrigued by his description and rallied Jamie and Davin over one day and together we removed a few massive boulders from beneath the start, began building the landing and cleaning the holds. I was not convinced it was possible, so we called in the big gun, Jimmy. Together we sussed out the beta and Jimmy almost took it down on his second or third day on the problem. A fierce flapper on one of the last moves meant a return trip was in order. This climb does start on a jug at the base of the wall, but it is underclinging and therefor a little less discernable. The rock is very good, although it is a big abrasive, and the small left hand crimp takes some skin. It is a great height and the landing is now almost entirely flat. It is singular, however, there are a couple other great problems around the right corner. The setting is unreal, as the problem overlooks a beautiful alpine lake and miles of mountainous terrain. The rock does have a decent amount of white crust on it, which is visually a little unpleasant, but can and will clean up with more action. I one day hope I can climb this problem!

He started the problem as a run and jump off this pedestal, but really you can just jump from the rock or lean over and cut like I do. It’s pretty scary to start no matter which method you use. Originally this climb was given V12 and squeezed directly out the prow, which is the beta I’m using here. A few years ago when Brian Nugent and Bryce Viola were on a tear across the US they found beta which goes much direct, which is how I ended up doing it. They called it V9, in reality it is probably V11 or V10 that way. \n\nThese two betas created a lot of contention over the quality and the grade, many people still choose to climb it with the original beta and take the original grade. It is a little less cool of a line with the easier beta and its a shame it avoids the really nice compression holds and sequence. Here I was climbing with Pablo, Katie, and Will who use the lingo “Surgical.” Surgical means great quality rock which has no holds other than what is needed to climb the boulder. It’s rare to find truly surgical boulders and they are arguably more special and high-quality than rock faces that are heavily featured and have lots of options. This problem could have been considered surgical with the original method, but the new beta makes it so that there are extra holds and therefore the rock is less surgical and the problem is lower quality, in my opinion. \n\nThe stone is really good, but of course not as bullet as southeast sandstone. The crimps on the face up top are the slightest bit flaky and thin and as with any desert sandstone could one day break. The landing is quite good but does slant away a tiny bit. For some reason this problem was really intimidating for me and it is quite tall and proud. \n\nThe start grip is obvious although it could be argued that the jump/reach start is a positive or negative factor.
